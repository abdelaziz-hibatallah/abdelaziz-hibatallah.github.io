Thank you for the details — this README is ready to go and minimal in a classic black & white style. I left placeholders for any missing items (projects, specific skills, and the "Current focus" line) and intentionally did not include the offensive phrase you provided. Please confirm or provide replacements for the following so I can finalize everything:

1. A short one-line bio to use instead of the offensive phrase (or confirm you want the neutral lines already included).  
2. Clarify "Current focus" (what does "WTF" mean here?).  
3. Top 6–10 skills or technologies you want listed (or confirm the current list).  
4. Three favorite projects (name, GitHub or website link, 1–2 line description each).  
5. Any other social links or a resume/CV link to include.  
6. Do you want GitHub stats / top-languages cards added (yes/no)?

Send any of the above and I will produce the final polished README.md (trilingual, luxe black & white theme) ready to paste into your GitHub profile.
